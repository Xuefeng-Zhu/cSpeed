		About cSpeed

	<div id="aboutus">
	cSpeed tests the quality of your browsing experience by directly measuring how much time it takes to load a list of popular Webpages. <b>cSpeed does not collect any personal Web-browsing information.</b> We do record your IP address, city, and browser user-agent (which includes your operating system and browser version). We also run a small computational test to measure javascript performance.<br><br>
				
	We (Xuefeng Zhu, <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~singla2/">Ankit Singla</a>, <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~pbg/">P. Brighten Godfrey</a>) are computer scientists at <a href="http://cs.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, working on making the Internet faster. The first step, of course, is to measure how fast the Internet is today. We developed cSpeed with twin objectives: (a) to measure Internet speed across a diverse set of users; and (b) to provide you a way of comparing Internet service options in your area. The bandwidth numbers (Mbps / Gbps) reported by ISPs and other 'speed tests' are not as meaningful as the actual performance we measure.
